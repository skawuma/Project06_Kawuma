## Explanation:

Project 04  Implements a program that reads a list of Integer numbers from the scanned input and saves them into a Linked List sorted from the smallest to the largest

Lastly to generate my javadocs, i make sure am out of the src folder then run the command that is going to create the folder "doc" that is going to hold my javadocs

 javadoc -d doc src/main/java/org/skawuma/StackImpl.java

## Code ReUse
Example of code reuse in my program was
1.  Collections.sort()\
    java.util.Collections.sort() method is present in java.util.Collections class. It is used to sort the elements present in the specified list of Collection in ascending order.
2.  Integer parseInt (String s)\
    This method parses the String argument as a signed decimal integer object.

3. String.valueOf()\
   The java string valueOf() method converts different types of values into string.

4. numbers.push()\
   The Stack push() method pushes (appends) an element to a Stack. It can be used for Stack and Queues.


## Explanation:
Project 05 is a maintenance task and not re-writing the program from scratch.

4. numbers.add()\
   The List add() method adds (appends) an element to a list. It can be used for both ArrayList and LinkedList.
